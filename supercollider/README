# note that it's insecure, you should only allow the container and not everybody

group audio must have the same id in the container and in the host

Make it work on your machine !
------------------------------

Yeah sure docker images should be hardware agnostic
but it was just easier for me to have my own config in the image
so indeed, "works on my machine"

change the /etc/asound.conf file (override it with ~/.asoundrc)
and change the jackd start command with the right -dhw: option
in files/init.sh (/usr/local/bin/init.sh)

/usr/bin/jackd -r -dalsa -dhw:CODEC,0 -r48000 -p1024
